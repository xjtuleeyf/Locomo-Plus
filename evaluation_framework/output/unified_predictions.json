It's a relaxing way to take a break from everyday stress.\nSam：Wow Evan, that's an awesome painting! Good on you for finding a way to de-stress. I could really use something like that - maybe I'll give painting a go or find another calming hobby.\nEvan：It's been great! I find painting to be a great stress reliever.

Yeah, I've been thinking about trying yoga, something gentle yet effective for stress relief and flexibility. What's your take on it, Sam?\nEvan：Yoga's definitely a great start, Sam.

I remember you’ve been choosing to stay debt-free as a core value, especially after everything you’ve been working toward with adoption, your art, and your advocacy. It’s not just about a phone—it's about keeping your future solid for the bigger goals you care about.\n\nIf coworkers tease you, you can own it with a quick line like, “I’m keeping things lean so I can focus on bigger priorities—adoption, counseling training, and building my future family.” Or keep it light: “This old phone still works fine for me; I’d rather put my money toward something that matters more right now.”\n\nIf you’re thinking about a practical path, you could:\n- set a small upgrade budget that’s tied to a milestone (e.g., after you finalize adoption paperwork or hit a fundraising goal),\n- look for budget-friendly options or refurbished models,\n- or swap in a temporary workaround (new battery, case, or accessories) to freshen things up without a full upgrade.\n\nYou’re doing amazing work aligning your finances with your values.
